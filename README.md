### Data Analysis of MrBeast YouTube Channels: Main Channel Exploration

#### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance metrics of MrBeast's YouTube channels, with a specific focus on the main channel. The analysis covers various aspects such as views, likes, comments, and their ratios, aiming to gain insights into video engagement and audience interaction trends.

#### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Plotly & Bokeh: For creating interactive plots.

#### Steps Taken in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - Loaded data from the CSV file containing metrics for MrBeast's YouTube videos.
   - Ensured numeric columns (Views, Likes, Comments) were properly converted and handled missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between Views, Likes, Comments, and their ratios.
   - Generated histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data patterns.

3. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Utilized Plotly and Bokeh to create interactive plots for deeper exploration of data trends.
   - Created scatter plots with interactive tooltips to visualize relationships between Views, Likes, and other metrics.

4. **Insights and Findings:**
   - Identified outliers and high-engagement videos based on thresholds.
   - Analyzed correlations between metrics to understand viewer engagement dynamics.

#### Publishing Interactive Plots

To share the insights and interactive visualizations:
- **GitHub Repository:** Create a GitHub repository named **MrBeast-YouTube-Analysis** or similar.
  - Upload Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and plotting.
  - Include an HTML folder for storing interactive Plotly and Bokeh plots.
  
- **GitHub Pages:** Host the interactive HTML plots on GitHub Pages.
  - Provide links to the hosted plots in the repository's README or project documentation.

- **Chart Studio (for Plotly plots):** Optionally, upload Plotly plots to Chart Studio for easy sharing and embedding.

#### Conclusion

This project not only provides a comprehensive analysis of MrBeast's main YouTube channel but also showcases the use of Python libraries for data exploration and visualization. By leveraging interactive plotting capabilities, the analysis offers a dynamic way to explore and understand video engagement metrics.
